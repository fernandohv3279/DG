# Introduction to Differential Manifolds
Extensive notes for a one-semester graduate course on differential geometry, written by [Clayton Shonkwiler](https://shonkwiler.org). 

The goal was to cover a number of standard topics (vector fields, differential forms and integration, Lie groups and homogeneous spaces, and Riemannian geometry) with an emphasis on symmetry and on simple examples, especially examples related to [frame theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_(linear_algebra)). 

The notes are available either [as a PDF](dg.pdf) or [as an accessible web page](https://shonkwiler.github.io/DG/).
